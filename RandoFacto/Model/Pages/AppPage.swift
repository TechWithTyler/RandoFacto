// CaseIterable allows you to iterate through an enum's caaes as if it were a collection. Getting the rawValue String of a case without an explicit raw value returns the case name converted from camelCase to all lowercase. When displaying page names, we want them in title-case, so the rawValue is capitalized anywhere it's displayed.

    // Don't include Settings as a page on macOS--it's accessed via the Settings option in the app menu.
